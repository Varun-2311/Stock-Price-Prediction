# Stock-Price-Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict the future price of a stock given the current or historical prices of the stock. The stock that we have chosen for this experiment is TATA, which is a well-established Indian Company.
We have done this by following the complete ML Life Cycle.

We have pre-processed and cleaned the data before passing it to various ML Models used to forecaset the price of stock. The final predicted results are a comprehensive study of the historical values of the stock and they match with the current value with a small error/variation. The final graph can then be used to derive valuable insights and to make judgement calls.

# Models Used
1. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
2. Different variations of the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.

# Process Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Scaling
3. Building the RNN
4. Adding LSTM layers
5. Forecasting the price 
6. Visualising the results
